## Analysis Summary & Conclusions

I analyzed the real-estate CRM using event-level data covering ~15,000 leads, ~82,000 CRM events, and ~800 confirmed bookings over an 18-month period. The objective was diagnostic: understand how leads move through the sales funnel, identify where conversions fail, and isolate system and process gaps driving those failures.

## Funnel Behavior & Drop-Offs

From the analysis, lead acquisition and initial contact are not the primary issues.

- ~84% of leads are successfully contacted  
- Only ~39% of contacted leads proceed to a site visit  
- Conversion from negotiation to booking is ~16%  
- Overall, only ~5–6% of total leads convert to bookings  

The largest drop-offs occur:

- After initial contact, before site visit (over 7,000 leads lost)  
- During the negotiation stage (over 4,000 leads lost)  

This shows that the funnel is leaking heavily after engagement begins, indicating problems with lead qualification, engagement quality, and closing effectiveness rather than lead volume.

## Time & Responsiveness

Response time is one of the strongest predictors of conversion.

- Average time to first contact is ~12 hours  
- Average lead-to-booking cycle is ~21 days  
- Average site-visit-to-booking time is ~10 days  

**SLA impact is extreme:**

- Leads with no SLA breach show near-complete conversion  
- Leads with any SLA breach convert at ~2–3%  

The CRM currently allows SLA breaches without enforcement or escalation. Once responsiveness drops, conversion almost completely collapses. This is a process control failure, not an effort issue.

## Follow-Up Behavior

Follow-up analysis shows clear and consistent patterns:

- Leads with zero follow-ups show 0% conversion  
- Leads with 1–5 follow-ups convert at ~6%  
- Conversion peaks around 6–10 follow-ups (~7%)  
- Additional follow-ups beyond this show diminishing returns  

This indicates that follow-ups are necessary to convert, but excessive follow-ups without progress signal poor qualification rather than increased buyer intent.

## Lead Quality & Budget Sensitivity

Budget segmentation reveals strong differences in conversion efficiency:

- Leads in the 80L–1.2Cr range convert at ~9%  
- Leads in the 50–80L range convert at ~4%  
- Leads below 50L convert at ~2%  

Despite this, lower-budget leads form a large portion of total volume and consume significant sales effort. Treating all leads equally is leading to inefficient use of sales resources.

## Sales Executive Performance

Lead distribution across sales executives is relatively even (roughly 470–530 leads per executive), but outcomes vary significantly:

- Booking conversion ranges from ~3.5% to over ~7% across executives  
- Revenue contribution varies widely despite similar lead volumes  
- Average time to close ranges from ~19.5 days to over ~22 days  
- Sales experience shows no strong correlation with conversion rate  

This indicates that performance differences are driven by process adherence and negotiation effectiveness, not tenure or workload. High-performing behaviors are not currently being identified or scaled.

## System Issues Identified

Across the analysis, several systemic gaps are consistent:

- No enforced first-contact SLA despite its strong impact on conversion  
- No visibility into stalled or at-risk leads  
- No governance on follow-up quantity or timing  
- No differentiated handling of low-ROI lead segments  
- No structured mechanism to identify and replicate top-performer practices  

Overall, the CRM is functioning primarily as a logging system, not a decision-support system.

## Recommendations

Based on the data, I recommend the following actions:

- Enforce a strict first-contact SLA (e.g., 24 hours) with automated alerts and escalation  
- Introduce structured qualification checks before scheduling site visits  
- Standardize negotiation playbooks based on top-performing executives  
- Segment and route low-budget leads differently to reduce wasted effort  
- Define minimum and optimal follow-up ranges within the CRM  
- Track conversion rate, revenue, and cycle time per executive as core operating metrics  

Each recommendation directly targets a point where measurable drop-offs or inefficiencies occur.

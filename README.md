## Event-Level CRM Sales Funnel & Conversion Analysis for a Real-Estate Developer

📌 Project Overview

This project is a diagnostic analysis of a real-estate sales CRM system using event-level data.
The goal is to understand how leads move through the sales funnel, identify where and why conversions fail, and highlight system and process gaps that impact overall sales performance.


🎯 Business Context

Real-estate sales teams handle large volumes of leads generated from multiple channels such as digital ads, property portals, referrals, and walk-ins.
Despite healthy lead inflow, many organizations struggle with:

-Low lead-to-booking conversion
-High drop-offs at specific funnel stages
-Inconsistent follow-up and SLA adherence
-Variation in sales executive performance

Management requires diagnostic insights, not just summary metrics, to improve conversion efficiency and revenue outcomes.

🗂️ Data Description

The analysis is based on CRM-style event-level data, similar to exports from real-world systems such as Salesforce or Zoho CRM.

The dataset includes:

-Lead master data (source, budget, assignment, project)
-CRM activity and stage transition logs
-Booking and revenue records
-Sales executive information

Each sales interaction is captured as a time-stamped event, allowing the full sales journey of every lead to be reconstructed and analyzed.

🧠 Analytical Approach

The project follows a SQL-first analytical workflow, reflecting how data is typically analyzed in enterprise environments:

-Validate and understand raw CRM exports
-Reconstruct the sales funnel from event logs
-Analyze funnel progression and drop-offs
-Study time delays, follow-up behavior, and SLA adherence
-Evaluate sales team performance and workload distribution
-Diagnose system and process weaknesses

The emphasis is on root-cause analysis and actionable insights rather than just descriptive statistics.

📘 Project Scope

This repository contains:

-SQL scripts used for data modeling and analysis
-Structured documentation explaining the analytical approach
-A analysis document detailing findings, system gaps, and recommendations


🧾 Purpose of This Project

This project demonstrates:

-How event-level CRM data can be used to diagnose sales performance issues
-Practical SQL skills applied to real operational problems
-Analytical thinking focused on systems, processes, and decision support
